1920,default,40,Yes,"This task became increasingly difficult as the questions progressed. My brain was trying to parse the meaning and intention of the speaker in every which way, and after re-reading the sentences over and over, the words started to become meaningless agglomerations of sounds that seemed separate from human speech. But I'm having breathing difficulties today so maybe my brain is hypoxic. What might help in this task is adding avatar images, little faces to personalize the names of the speakers, that way it wouldn't just be a string of text that, after a dozen or so, becomes difficult to interpret. Just an idea. If I could imagine these bits of conversation coming out of the mouths of real people, it would help me visualize the conversation better and perhaps better attribute intention and certainty to the speaker.

1903,default,26,Yes,"Sometimes I questioned the meaning of ""certain"" as it was used in some of the given sentences. I also wondered how people might interpret the sentences differently and how just reading the sentences and not being able to hear certain inflections made things less clear. For instance, there were sentences where someone would mention that someone else ""didn't prove"" something. I interpreted these sentences in this way: that something could be true or false, but either way, it just wasn't proven by that someone else. Therefore, I can't give a definitive answer as to how certain that someone is about that something being true. They could just be stating an objective fact that someone else didn't prove that something to be true. ",Female,"English, Mandarin",

Of course I was not asked and didn't say I have Dyslexia, which I overcome as best I can.  These were challenging and hopefully I didn't take too long to complete them!  But if you examine the sentences you see what Dyslexic people go through every day trying to ""figure out"" rapidly and accurately over and over what each person is really saying so that I can respond with a comment or answer or question that truly is responsive to what I just heard.
