README

This GitHub repository contains the experiments and results pertaining to the CommitmentBank+ project, that is, the extension of the CommitmentBank (de Marneffe et al 2019) with certainty, at-issueness, and prior ratings. 

Because the CommitmentBank contains both indicative and question target sentences, the first four experiments compare projection ratings to at-issueness ratings under different diagnostics for at-issueness based on the stimuli used in Tonhauser & Degen (under re-review) and Degen & Tonhauser (accepted, Open Mind). 

The next set of experiments to be included in this repo will pertain to the annotation of the CommitmentBank stimuli with certainty, at-issueness, and prior ratings.

For experiments 1_ to 4_:
20 clause-embedding predicates,
20 clauses 
2 blocks in each experiment

1_projaiQ: polar question stimuli, certainty ratings, "asking whether" at-issueness ratings
[these data already exist, copied over from JT's attitude_preds_projection github repo]

2_projaiN: negation stimuli, certainty ratings, "are you sure that" at-issueness ratings

3_projaiM: modal stimuli, certainty ratings, "are you sure that" at-issueness ratings

4_projaiC: conditional stimuli, certainty ratings, "are you sure that" at-issueness ratings
